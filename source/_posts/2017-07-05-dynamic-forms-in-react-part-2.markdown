## Recap Part 1

In [Part 1]('https://sammysteiner.github.io/blog/2017/07/02/dynamic-forms-in-react/'), we talked about simple forms in React. Namely, we talked about controlling inputs, updating state, and handling submissions. All of that assumes our form is static and we know the shape of our state. 'Shape' in this context means the data contained in the state object, the keys, the types of values, etc.

In part two, we're going to talk about a more complex form. This form needs a way to update itself, and because we want to control the inputs, the form needs a way to update the state. Finally, when we send off our state object to an API, we need to know how to deconstruct that state regardless of how many phases and actions a user added to our form.

Here's our gif from Part 1 to demonstrate the kind of form interaction we're going for:
