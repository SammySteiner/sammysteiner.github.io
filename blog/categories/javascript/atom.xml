    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What is a Nested Dynamic Form</h2>

<p>Sometimes a form needs to expect the unexpected. When that happens, when the user needs freedom and flexibility, old-school forms just wont cut it. For Habits, I wanted to give the user the ability to add as many fields to the form as they needed to express their goal.</p>

<p>Habits is an activity tracking app that is part accountability through gamificaiton, part exploration of the quantified self, and part guided self betterment. When using the Goal creation form, users are encouraged to give their goal a name, as well as a brief description or motivational sentence. Then, users are asked to divide their goal into smaller, more manageable chunks, divided into phases of time, and each phase is comprised of various actions. When the goal is created, the user&rsquo;s inputs are translated into a card that allows them to check off what they&rsquo;ve accomplished toward their goal, divides up the work according to their schedule, and gives them insights into their progress.</p>

<p>In order to cover all that, our form needs to be very special. This is what it&rsquo;s going to look like:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/goalForm.gif" alt="Dynamic form gif" /></p>

<p>But we won&rsquo;t get to that in this post. In this post, we will go through the basics of React forms to get us up to speed for what&rsquo;s coming in our next post.</p>

<h2>Standard Javascript Forms</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s build a simple from to accept a &lsquo;name&rsquo; input from the user and send if off to our database, in vanilla Javascript. Here&rsquo;s what our form would look like.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id="goal-form"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name" /&gt;  
  &lt;input type="submit" value="submit"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Next we need to create an event handler on window.load to listen for the submit event and hanle sending our information to the api.</p>

<pre><code>document.querySelector("#goal-form").addEventListener("submit", function(e){
    e.preventDefault()    
    // stop the form from submitting and refreshing the page
    // you can add some validations here
    var name = document.getElementById('name').value
    return createGoal(name)
    // calling some function that sends a post request to our api with the value of the name input.    
})
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s one way to do things in vanilla Javascript. It&rsquo;s messy, slow, and not very efficient. Things can get even crazier when there are lots of elements on your page. Searching through all those DOM nodes can get expensive. And when we want to do something dynamic in our form, like in the example above, this process can get very complicated very quickly. React gives us a better way.</p>

<h2>Controlled inputs</h2>

<p>In React, we try and stay away from the DOM, and use the virtual DOM instead. This means that when we go and look at what the user entered in our form, instead of checking for the form input values in the DOM, we store it in temporary memory, in the React component&rsquo;s state, and just grab it from there when we&rsquo;re ready.</p>

<p>Our React state for a name input looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>...
export default class GoalForm extends Component {
  constructor(){
    super()
    this.state = {
      name: ''
    }
  }
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>All this does is create a GoalForm class component in React with a state object that has a value of &lsquo;name&rsquo;, which points to an empty string.</p>

<p>Instead of having the React component store the information of the user&rsquo;s input and have the user&rsquo;s input be stored in the DOM, which would break the single source of truth convention, we just have the component&rsquo;s value display the state. That is called a controlled input.</p>

<p>Our form looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit.bind(this)}&gt;
  &lt;input label='name' type='text' value={this.state.name} onChange={this.handleChange.bind(this)} /&gt;
  &lt;input type='submit' value='submit' /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This form has one text input field for a name, that shows the value of the name object in the component&rsquo;s state. When a user enters something in the input field, that input is intercepted by our handleChange function, which updates the state, the Component is re-rendered, and the new state is shown as the value.</p>

<h2>Handling Changes and form Submission</h2>

<p>Our handleSubmit and handleChange functions look like this:</p>

<pre><code>handleSubmit(e){
  e.preventDefault()
  this.props.createGoal(this.state.name)
  // this is a function passed down from another component via props. In this case, it will send a post request to an api with the 'name' the user entered.
  this.setState({name: ''})
  // this.setState is a React function that sets the state of the current component to the argument that is passed in and it also forces the component to re-render.
}

handleChange(e){
  e.preventDefault()
  this.setState({name: e.target.value })
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is a lot to wrap your head around, controlled inputs, preventing a lot of default actions, completely sidestepping the DOM! I know, it&rsquo;s a lot. But it&rsquo;s about to get crazier. In part two, we&rsquo;ll discuss how to give the user the ability to dynamically add inputs in this controlled system. Stay tuned for part II</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Our goal is to get a project up and running quickly. If you haven&rsquo;t done this before, first we want to create a project directory, create a github repository, and then link the two. Here are the basic steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Navigate to your development folder in Terminal.</li>
<li>Type <code>mkdir "project-name"</code> in terminal to create a project folder.</li>
<li>Type <code>cd "project-name"</code> in Terminal to navigate into your project directory.</li>
<li>Type <code>git init</code> in Terminal to set up your directory as a git repository.</li>
<li>Create a readme file by typing <code>touch README.md</code> in Terminal.</li>
<li>Add and commit your new repository by typing <code>git add .</code> and  <code>git commit -m "first commit"</code>.</li>
<li>To create a github repository, login to <a href="https://github.com">github</a> in your browser and navigate to <a href="https://github.com/new">github/new</a> to create a new repository.</li>
<li>Once there, give your repository a name, use the same one as your project directory, and leave the &ldquo;Initialize this repository with a README&rdquo; option unchecked.</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Create Repository&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Back in Terminal, type <code>git remote add origin git@github.com:your-git-username/your-repository-name.git</code> to set up the connection between the folder on your computer, and the repository in github.</li>
<li>Then type <code>git push -u origin master</code> to push the files, ie. your readme, from your project folder to github.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now that your project is up and running, it&rsquo;s time to create a testing environment.</p>

<h2>Jasmine versus Mocha</h2>

<p>There are two very popular testing libraries for Javascript, Jasmine and Mocha. Both are great, and weighing the pros and cons of each is enough for another blog post. Some people have already written great articles on the topic here:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.techtalkdc.com/which-javascript-test-library-should-you-use-qunit-vs-jasmine-vs-mocha/">Kevin Groat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://marcofranssen.nl/jasmine-vs-mocha/">Marco Franssen</a></li>
</ol>


<p>I&rsquo;m more familiar with Mocha, so we&rsquo;re going to go with that.</p>

<h2>Setting up Mocha</h2>

<p>First we need to create our NPM dependencies, with a package.json file. There is a great walkthrough built in for us by typing <code>npm init</code> in Terminal. Just follow the promts and include a name, repo, and some other metadata in the form. That will create a package.json file in your project folder. Don&rsquo;t forget to add/commit your changes frequently.</p>

<p>Create a mocha dependency in your project package.json file by typing <code>npm install --save mocha</code> in Terminal. Create a test file with <code>atom test/test.js</code>. I&rsquo;m using Atom, but you can replace that with your editor of choice.</p>

<p>This is where it can get pretty hairy. There is a lot to install to get up and running. I would advise starting off with a simple test and some simple code just to have something to test against. We also need to require the files with our code and assign it to a variable, as well as require any other mocha assertion libraries you want to use. My basic test.js setup looks like this:</p>

<p>In test.js:
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">In terminal: `npm install --save expect.js`</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">Now we&#39;re ready to start writing our functions. If you want to build out this application, you can move all your inclusions and exporting responsibilities to a root.js file in your test folder. That will allow you to write your functions normally and branch out to other .js files without things getting to messy. But more on that in another blog.</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">to pass our first test, add the following code to index.js:</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;/</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/pre&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>But we&rsquo;re still not passing our test yet. With mocha, it&rsquo;s not enough to just include it in the test.js file, we need to export them from our index.js file as well. We do this with some general code at the bottom of our file that we update with each additional function. Here&rsquo;s what we need at the bottom of index.js to export our first test:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">if(typeof exports !== 'undefined') {
    exports.test = test
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you should be passing your first test. Hurray! Now that you&rsquo;re up and running. The <a href="https://mochajs.org">mocha documentation</a> on how to write more complex tests is a great resource.</p>

<h2>Bonus</h2>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to export every function in your index.js file. You only need to export the functions that your tests will call on. So if you have a function called <code>testTwo</code> that should accept two arguments, multiply them, and return the result, you can export it in your exports like <code>exports.testTwo = testTwo</code>. However, if that function just returns a helper function, called <code>multiplier(num1, num2)</code>, you would not need to export that function as well.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what this test looks like in test.js:
<code>ruby
describe ('test2', function() {
  it('multiplies two numbers together', function() {
    expect(myCode.testTwo(3, 5)).to.be(15)
  })
})
</code></p>

<p>And here is how you would pass it in index.js. Note that you do not need to export <code>multiplier</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">var testTwo = function(num1, num2) {
  return mulitplier(num1, num2)
}

var mulitplier = function(a, b) {
  return a * b
}

if(typeof exports !== 'undefined') {
    exports.test = test;
    exports.testTwo = testTwo
}
</code></pre>
